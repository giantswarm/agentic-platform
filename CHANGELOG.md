## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Single `ingress.mode` topology selector (`muster-direct` | `agentgateway-muster` | `agentgateway-direct`) that declares the whole request topology in one place. The umbrella now owns **both** public routes — muster's `/` catch-all (new `templates/ingress/muster-httproute.yaml`, rendered in all modes) and the agentgateway `/mcp` interception route — fed from a single shared `ingress.parentRefs` / `ingress.hostnames`, so the two routes can no longer drift. A template-time guard (`templates/validate.yaml`) fails fast on an invalid mode, on `ingress.parentRefs` empty in **any** mode (the umbrella-owned muster `/` route attaches to it — an empty `parentRefs` would otherwise render a route bound to no Gateway), and on `agentgateway.enabled` / `agentic-platform-mcps.agentgateway.viaMuster` disagreeing with the mode.
- `agentgateway.enabled` (default `false`) gates the agentgateway controller dependency via `condition: agentgateway.enabled` in `Chart.yaml`. In the default `muster-direct` mode the controller, its `GatewayClass`, the data-plane `Gateway`/`AgentgatewayParameters`, and the data-plane NetworkPolicies are **not installed**.
- `agentgateway-direct` mode is modelled but **fail-guarded** — install is blocked with a clear message until a DCR-capable IdP (RFC 7591/8707) lands.
- `make verify-modes` target (wired into a new CircleCI branch test job) asserts the fail-guards fire; `ci/test-full-stack-values.yaml` now exercises the previously-untested `agentgateway-muster` path.
- Route-scoped `BackendTrafficPolicy` for muster's `/` route (new `templates/ingress/muster-backendtrafficpolicy.yaml`), rendered in **all** modes when `ingress.backendTrafficPolicy.enabled` is set — not just the agentgateway `/mcp` route. This preserves muster's `401 … WWW-Authenticate` challenge against the cluster-wide error-pages policy in `muster-direct` mode (where muster serves `/mcp` directly) and restores the pre-refactor `muster.gatewayAPI.backendTrafficPolicy` behavior on muster's own route.
- Per-route `ingress.httpRoute.muster.{annotations,labels}` and `ingress.httpRoute.mcp.{annotations,labels}` overrides, merged on top of the shared `ingress.httpRoute.{annotations,labels}` (per-route keys win on collision). Lets a downstream diverge one route — e.g. a different cert-manager issuer or Envoy route policy per route — without forking the shared block.

### Fixed

- In-cluster MCP backends that listen on a non-80/443 port (e.g. the bundled `pro` / `runbooks` MCP servers on `8080`, reached via a ClusterIP) were unreachable from muster — its sub-chart CNP permits cluster-entity egress only on 80/443, so those connections timed out and the corresponding `MCPServer`s went `Failed`. The umbrella now renders a supplementary `CiliumNetworkPolicy` (`<muster>-mcp-egress`) that widens muster's egress to `networkPolicy.musterInClusterMcpPorts` (default `[8080]`; cilium flavor only; Cilium policies are additive, so no sub-chart fork). Set to `[]` to disable.
- **Muster Service name is now pinned** via `muster.fullnameOverride: agentic-platform-muster`, read directly by the umbrella's `agentic-platform.musterFullname` helper instead of re-deriving the muster sub-chart's release-name algorithm. The route `backendRef`, the `BackendTrafficPolicy` target, and `agentic-platform-mcps.musterUrl` now reference one source of truth that stays in lockstep with the sub-chart's Service regardless of release name or any future muster naming change. A blank override fails the render loudly rather than silently pointing the route at a non-existent Service (503).

### Changed

- Bumped bundled `muster` to `0.2.1` (stable; muster#772 JWT signing-key wiring fix + `jwt_key.go` enabling edge JWT validation, and the CNP ingress-gateway egress fix from muster#788).
- Bumped bundled `agentic-platform-mcps` to `0.2.4` — corrects the `identityProviders` value schema (it was `additionalProperties: false` with no properties, forbidding every provider key and making `auth.mode: exchange` unconfigurable). Unblocks multi-cluster token-exchange consumers; `forward`-only installs are unaffected.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `gateway.enabled`, `gateway.httpRoute.*`, and `gateway.backendTrafficPolicy.*` are removed — replaced by `ingress.mode` (topology switch), `ingress.parentRefs` / `ingress.hostnames` (shared route attachment), and `ingress.backendTrafficPolicy.*`. The retained `gateway.*` keys now hold data-plane *infrastructure* only and apply in `agentgateway-*` modes. `muster.gatewayAPI.enabled` is now `false` (the umbrella renders muster's public route) — set `ingress.parentRefs` / `ingress.hostnames` instead of `muster.gatewayAPI.httpRoute.*`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- `agentic-platform-mcps` bundled as a conditional sub-chart (`condition: mcps.enabled`, default `false`). It renders the platform's MCP server CRs (muster `MCPServer` and/or agentgateway `AgentgatewayBackend` + `AgentgatewayPolicy`) from one abstract `agentic-platform-mcps.mcpServers` list. The toggle lives in a separate top-level `mcps:` block because the sub-chart's strict `values.schema.json` (`additionalProperties: false`) rejects an `enabled` key. The CRs consume CRDs shipped by the companion `agentic-platform-crds` chart — the umbrella still installs **zero** CRDs. New `ci/test-mcps-values.yaml` exercises the path.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Extended restricted-PSS `securityContext` defaults to the bundled valkey **metrics exporter sidecar** (`valkey.valkey.metrics.exporter.securityContext`). 0.4.0 hardened the main valkey container and its init container, but the `redis_exporter` sidecar (`containers[1]`, port 9121) lives under a separate values key and was still rejected by Kyverno's `disallow-privilege-escalation` policy.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Restored restricted-PSS compliant `securityContext`/`podSecurityContext` defaults on the bundled valkey sub-chart, which were inadvertently dropped during the CRD-chart split (0.3.0). Without them, Kyverno's `disallow-privilege-escalation` and `restrict-seccomp-strict` policies reject the `muster-valkey` Deployment because the init container reuses the main container's `securityContext` and the upstream defaults omit `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` and `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- New `agentic-platform-crds` chart (`helm/agentic-platform-crds/`): a CRD-only umbrella that vendors the upstream `agentgateway-crds` (`v1.2.1`) and `muster-crds` sub-charts, shipping all five CRDs the platform's CRs consume. Install it **before** `agentic-platform`; CRD and workload lifecycles are now decoupled (two releases in sequence, Flux/Argo-agnostic). The muster CRDs are `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`-protected via `muster-crds.crds.annotations`.
- Second CircleCI `architect/push-to-app-catalog` job (`package-and-push-crds-chart`) building and publishing `agentic-platform-crds` alongside `agentic-platform` on git tags.

### Changed

- All CRDs moved out of `agentic-platform` into the new `agentic-platform-crds` chart. `agentic-platform` now installs **zero** CRDs — it renders only the CRs (`Gateway`, `AgentgatewayParameters`, plus muster's). `helm template agentic-platform` emitting any `CustomResourceDefinition` is a regression.
- `muster.crds.install` defaulted to `false` in `agentic-platform` values, so the bundled `muster` sub-chart renders no CRDs (the currently pinned muster `0.1.197` still defaults `crds.install: true`).
- `Chart.yaml` description: CRDs now ship in the companion `agentic-platform-crds` chart.

### Removed

- `agentgateway-crds` sub-chart dependency (`condition: agentgateway-crds.enabled`) and the `agentgateway-crds:` values block from `agentic-platform`. The CRDs are provided by `agentic-platform-crds`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- `agentgateway-crds` bundled as a conditional sub-chart (`condition: agentgateway-crds.enabled`, default `true`) so the umbrella is self-contained. The chart now ships the `AgentgatewayParameters` / `AgentgatewayPolicy` / `AgentgatewayBackend` CRDs alongside the `AgentgatewayParameters` CR it renders; Helm applies CRDs ahead of the CR via install ordering. Disable on clusters that manage these CRDs out of band.
- Agentgateway data-plane OTel env defaults: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otlp-gateway.kube-system.svc:4317` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc` added to `gateway.parameters.dataPlaneEnv`. Override to point at a different backend.
- `muster.serviceMonitor.enabled: true` default. OTel push to otlp-gateway is not yet supported by muster; ServiceMonitor is the primary observability path until muster gains an `otlpEndpoint` knob.
- `ci/test-full-stack-values.yaml` CI values file satisfying all fail-guards for a complete `helm template` render (OAuth off, valkey off, parentRefs stubbed).

### Changed

- `agentgateway-crds` is no longer a cluster prerequisite (now bundled). Muster's CRDs continue to ship via the muster sub-chart. **Caveat:** the upstream `agentgateway-crds` CRDs are not yet annotated `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so uninstalling the release deletes them and cascades to all agentgateway CRs cluster-wide. An upstream change to parameterize the CRD annotations is pending; the `keep` annotation will be added here once it lands.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Initial agentic-platform chart bundling `muster` 0.1.197 and `agentgateway` v1.2.1.
- `Gateway` (name `agentgateway`) and `AgentgatewayParameters` overlay injecting restricted-PSS `securityContext` on the controller-rendered data-plane pod.
- `gateway.parameters.serviceType` (default `ClusterIP`) overlays `AgentgatewayParameters.spec.service.type` so the data-plane Service stays internal; the controller hardcodes `LoadBalancer`.
- `gateway.parameters.dataPlaneEnv`, `dataPlaneVolumes`, `dataPlaneVolumeMounts` strategic-merge lists on the AgentgatewayParameters overlay.
- `CiliumNetworkPolicy` for the agentgateway **controller pod** in addition to the data-plane pod (upstream agentgateway chart ships no policies).
- `networking.k8s.io/v1 NetworkPolicy` rendering when `networkPolicy.flavor: kubernetes` — best-effort (no entity selectors, no FQDN egress).
- `networkPolicy.kubernetes.{apiServerCIDR,worldExcludedCIDRs}` for the `kubernetes` flavor.
- Top-level `extraObjects: []` rendering arbitrary manifests through `tpl` alongside the chart.
- `values.schema.json` covering top-level keys with a cross-field combo check (muster valkey storage requires `valkey.enabled` or an explicit URL).
- `UPGRADE.md` documenting the breaking changes for the first stable release.

### Changed

- CRD lifecycle: `agentgateway-crds` is a cluster prerequisite (upstream agentgateway ships controller + CRDs as separate charts). Muster's CRDs continue to ship inside the umbrella via the muster sub-chart's `templates/crds.yaml`.
- Data-plane policy selector switched to the Gateway-API standard label `gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name=<gateway.name>` (was `app.kubernetes.io/name=agentgateway`, which matched both the controller and the data plane).
- Controller policy selector uses the agentgateway sub-chart's selector triple (`agentgateway: agentgateway` + `app.kubernetes.io/name=agentgateway` + `app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release>`).
- Data-plane CNP gains xDS egress to the controller on TCP 9978; controller CNP gains xDS ingress from data-plane pods.
- `CiliumNetworkPolicy` egress covers `kube-dns`, `coredns`, `k8s-dns-node-cache` on 53 + 1053 (UDP + TCP); world 80/443; cluster 80/443 for in-cluster ingress (Dex / MCPServers); muster on 8090.
- Muster sub-chart's NetworkPolicy values migrate from `ciliumNetworkPolicy.*` to `networkPolicy.{enabled,flavor,cilium.allowClusterIngress,kubernetes.*}` (muster 0.1.197). Umbrella overrides `enabled: true`, `flavor: cilium`, `cilium.allowClusterIngress: true`.
- `valkey.enabled` and `muster.muster.oauth.server.enabled` default to `true`. Operators must provide `oauth.server.baseUrl`, `oauth.server.dex.{issuerUrl,clientId}`, `oauth.server.existingSecret`, and `valkey.valkey.auth.usersExistingSecret` — muster's template-time fail-guards reject install otherwise.
- `muster.gatewayAPI.httpRoute.parentRefs` / `.hostnames` no longer default to the data-plane Gateway. Muster's HTTPRoute must attach to the cluster's public Gateway (typically `envoy-gateway-system/giantswarm-default`); the muster fail-guard enforces this.
- Bundled `giantswarm/valkey-app` 0.1.2 as a conditional sub-chart (`condition: valkey.enabled`). Single Deployment + PVC; Service at `muster-valkey.<namespace>.svc:6379`. ACL-based auth: a `default` user with full permissions reads its password from `valkey-password` in `valkey.valkey.auth.usersExistingSecret`.
- Muster wired to the bundled valkey by default: `muster.muster.oauth.server.storage.type=valkey` and `storage.valkey.url=muster-valkey:6379`. Inert while `oauth.server.enabled: false`; kicks in the moment OAuth is enabled.
- `networkPolicy.flavor` enum changed from `cilium | none` to `cilium | kubernetes`. Opt out via `networkPolicy.enabled: false`.
- README is now Flux HelmRelease-first (no Giant Swarm App platform). Adds a "Gateway API CR ownership" section clarifying that only `AgentgatewayParameters` is vendor-specific to agentgateway.
- Templates grouped under `templates/agentgateway/` (Gateway, AgentgatewayParameters, four NetworkPolicy variants).
- `Chart.yaml` description reflects the runtime contract (muster + agentgateway + opt-in Valkey; CRDs as cluster prerequisite). `appVersion` stays at the umbrella's own `0.1.0`.

### Removed

- `bootstrap.oauth.*` values and the `templates/oauth-bootstrap-secret.yaml` Helm `lookup`-based Secret generator. Use `extraObjects` to ship the Secret in the same release, or pre-create it out of band and reference via `muster.muster.oauth.server.existingSecret`.
